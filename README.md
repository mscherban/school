# school
Various school projects done while pursuing my masters degree in computer engineering.

Each project uses either C, C++, or Verilog, with several of them containing Python scripts to facilitate exectution in bulk under different configurations.


Intentionally left in a vague state so that they are not easily found on Google- at the request of the school.
